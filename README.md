# Growth.DEV | PARIS 🇫🇷

Let's Talk about IPAs 🍻 & APIs 💻


In 2018, developers are considered to be the new workers 👷‍. In some companies, they are just there to piss some lines of codes. You deserve better than that. When you are a coding master, lots of opportunities are open to you: work closer to the product, work as a freelance from Bali 🏝️, ... Or be the Iron Arm of the business team?

Growth Engineer, this new job title in France is very popular in 🇺🇸. It's a creative, technical guy who works on the product side, marketing side, sales side by testing new experiments to create Growth.

With these series of Growth.Dev events, we want to share with you alternatives to only be a developer. Stories from people who switch from the traditional techy side to leverage the code in a different way. Create Growth 🛩

## What you will learn
```
During this workshop you will learn the basic of webscraping in Javascript. We will teach you how to use Puppeteer to transform your linkedin connection into an andress book!
```

> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). Puppeteer runs [headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

<!-- [START usecases] -->
###### What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
* Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
* Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
* Capture a [timeline trace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
* Test Chrome Extensions.
<!-- [END usecases] -->

## What you will discover

### How to Scale #DataOps

```
Romain is co-founder of Hull and a mentor at TechStars. His tip for scaling businesses to 
get the most out of their data: keep it simple. Whether it’s for sales, marketing, operations, 
getting bogged down too early in vast volumes of data is pitfall #1. Pitfall #2 comes as startups grow, 
not knowing how to structure their processes and leverage that data.
```
