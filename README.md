⭐️ STAR THE REPOSITORY IF YOU WANT TO ATTEND ⭐️

# Growth.DEV | PARIS 🇫🇷

Let's Talk about IPAs 🍻 & APIs 💻


In 2018, developers are considered to be the new workers 👷‍. In some companies, they are just there to piss some lines of codes. You deserve better than that. When you are a coding master, lots of opportunities are open to you: work closer to the product, work as a freelance from Bali 🏝️, ... Or be the Iron Arm of the business team?

Growth Engineer, this new job title in France is very popular in 🇺🇸. It's a creative, technical guy who works on the product side, marketing side, sales side by testing new experiments to create Growth.

With these series of Growth.Dev events, we want to share with you alternatives to only be a developer. Stories from people who switch from the traditional techy side to leverage the code in a different way. Create Growth 🛩

## What you will discover

### How to Scale #DataOps

```
Romain is co-founder of Hull and a mentor at TechStars. His tip for scaling businesses to 
get the most out of their data: keep it simple. Whether it’s for sales, marketing, operations, 
getting bogged down too early in vast volumes of data is pitfall #1. Pitfall #2 comes as startups grow, 
not knowing how to structure their processes and leverage that data.
